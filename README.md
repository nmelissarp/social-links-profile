## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
- If the screen is a mobile phone, tablet or computer, this should not affect the user experience.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Google Fonts] (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter)

### Continued development

- Customize the template with my own social links profile.

## Acknowledgments

Just remember that with this type of one-dimensional projects, with vertically stacked elements (image, name, location, description and buttons) it is better to use Flexbox to give structure to the page.
